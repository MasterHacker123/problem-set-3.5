      <p>
        Gravitation, or gravity, is one of the fundamental forces of the Universe that causes objects with mass or energy to be attracted to one another. Any object with mass or energy possesses its own gravitational force, although it is often negligible until you reach the size of celestial bodies. The gravitational force of an object positively correlates with its mass and/or energy. The more mass an object has, the greater its gravitational force. This is why the Earth is in orbit around the Sun and not vice versa (Copernicus for the win). Furthermore, the gravitational force of an object affects all other objects, irrespective of distance. This means that galaxies and stars trillions of miles away exert a gravitational force upon you in the same way that the Earth does. So does the pillow in your bedroom or a nearby car. The thing is, in most cases the force of gravity is so minor that it doesn’t affect electrons, quarks, photons, or neutrinos, much less humans. So how do we calculate the force of gravity in various systems? The following laws of physics and formulas will show you.

      <h3>Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation</h3>
      <p>
        This law states that all particles and objects exert a gravitational force on all other particles and objects that is directly proportional to their masses and indirectly proportional to the square of the distance between them. Both objects exert an equal force upon each other; it is inertia that determines the outcome of a gravitational interaction. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation can be summed up in the following formula, where F is the gravitational force, G is the universal gravitational constant, m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> represent the masses of the two objects, and r represents the distance between the two objects.

      <h3>Gravitational Field Intensity</h3>
      <p>
        A gravitational field is simply the region upon which an object exerts a gravitational force (the Universe). In order to calculate the intensity of a gravitational field, or the acceleration due to gravity of an object within that field, the following formula can be used.
